# -g produces debugging information in the OSÂ¹s native format (stabs, COFF, XCOFF, or DWARF 2).
# -ggdb produces debugging information specifically intended for gdb.
# -ggdb3 produces extra debugging information, for example: including macro definitions. -ggdb by itself without specifying the level defaults to
# -ggdb2 (i.e., gdb for level 2).

# how about optimizing???
# -Og reasonable level of optimization while maintaining fast compilation and a good debugging experience
# -O3 lots of optimization. pretty much destroys debugging

#   c should be treated as a "portable assembler" NOT a high level programming language
#   without a deep understanding of the language, its history, and its design goals,
